# ExPECA Project Website

## Getting started

Website is built using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
Each Markdown file in `./docs` corresponds to a page.

Easiest way to write and preview is by using the docker-compose configuration provided in `./docker`

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

The live preview will then be served at [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000).
